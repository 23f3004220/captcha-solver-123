# Simple Captcha Solver Application. This project provides a basic, single-file web application demonstrating a client-side Captcha solver. It's designed to be responsive and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The application allows users to load a captcha image, either from a default sample or a custom URL, and attempt to solve it. ## Features: Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across various devices. Dynamic Image Loading: Load captcha images from specified URLs or use the provided `sample.png`. URL Parameter Support: Images can be pre-loaded by passing a `url` query parameter (e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/my-captcha.png`). Client-Side Validation: Basic validation logic for the `sample.png` captcha. User Feedback: Provides immediate feedback on captcha submission. ## Getting Started. To run this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No special server setup is required for the basic functionality. ### Prerequisites: A modern web browser. ### Usage: 1. Open `index.html`: Navigate to the `index.html` file in your browser. 2. Default Captcha: The `sample.png` image will be loaded by default. The solution for `sample.png` is **ADCR3**. 3. Load Custom Image: Enter an image URL into the "Image URL" input field. Click "Load Image". Note: Client-side validation is only implemented for `sample.png`. For custom images, the app will indicate that it cannot validate them without a backend. 4. Solve Captcha: Type your solution into the "Enter Captcha" input field. Click "Submit" or press `Enter`. 5. View Feedback: The application will display whether your submission for `sample.png` was correct or incorrect. ## Project Structure: `index.html`: The main single-file HTML application, including all HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CDN), and JavaScript. `sample.png`: The default captcha image used by the application. ## Technologies Used: HTML5: For the core structure of the web page. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsiveness. JavaScript: For dynamic behavior, image loading, and captcha validation logic. ## License: This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
